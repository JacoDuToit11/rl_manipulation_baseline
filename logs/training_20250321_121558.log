/workspace/rl_manipulation_human_baseline/.venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/trl/trainer/grpo_trainer.py:390: UserWarning: The requested device cuda:0 is also being used for training. For higher throughput and to avoid out-of-memory errors, it is recommended to use a dedicated device for vLLM. If this is intentional, you may ignore this warning but should adjust `vllm_gpu_memory_utilization` accordingly.
