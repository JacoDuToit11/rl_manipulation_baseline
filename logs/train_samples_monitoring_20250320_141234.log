The midpoints $M_1$ and $M_2$ are connected by the line segment $M_1M_2 = \\sqrt{P M_1^2 + P M_2^2} = 25$. \n\nSince $P$ is the intersection point of the two perpendicular chords, it must lie on the perpendicular bisector of $M_1M_2$, with equal distances from both midpoints $M_1$ and $M_2$. This implies that $PM_1 = PM_2 = 25$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $PM_1M_2$, we have $r^2 = 25^2 + 25^2 = 500$, hence $r = \\sqrt{500}$.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distances $A M_1$ and $B M_2$ where $A$ and $B$ are the intersection points of the line $M_1M_2$ with the circle. \n\nThe distance between any two adjacent points $A$ and $B$ on the circumference of the circle, touching the perpendicular bisector of $M_1M_2$ at point $P$ and extending through $M_1$ and $M_2$, is $2r\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the central angle subtended by $M_1M_2$.\n\nSince the longest possible distance between the midpoints $M_1$ and $M_2$ is from the center to $M_1M_2$, the distance $M_1M_2 = 25$, and the radius is $r = \\sqrt{500}$, the maximum distance occurs when $PM_1 = PM_2 = 25$ and the circle is oriented such that $A$ and $B$ are such that half of the distance between $A$ and $B$ is on the circumference from $A$ to $B$ considering the circle's radius.\n\nThus, the maximum distance $B M_2 - A M_1 = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{(r^2 - \\frac{M_1^2 + M_2^2}{2})} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{500 - \\frac{2500}{2}}$. Simplifying, we get:\n\n<centering>\n\\[\n2 \\cdot \\sqrt{500 - 1250/2} = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{500 - 625/2} = 2 \\cdot 500/2 = 2 \\cdot 25 = 50\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $B M_2 - A M_1$ is $50$.</centering>\n\n<answer>50</answer>"]
